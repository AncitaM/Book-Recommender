The Book Recommender Project is a machine learning-based system designed to suggest books to users based on their reading preferences and ratings. Utilizing both popularity-based and collaborative filtering methods, the project processes datasets containing book ratings, user information, and book details. Popularity-based recommendations highlight top-rated books with significant user ratings, while collaborative filtering leverages user behavior to suggest books. The project is implemented in Python using libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn, and includes a Flask web application for an interactive user experience. Users can explore top book recommendations and receive personalized suggestions based on similar user preferences.
